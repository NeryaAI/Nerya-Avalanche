"""Nerya research package.

Implements the strategy research, validation, backtest, shadow runtime and
swarm primitives described in

The research layer is intentionally network-free at test time. All entry
points convert agent-authored signal engines into ``IntentCandidate``
objects, run deterministic fixture backtests and emit ``ValidationReport``
artifacts under ``workspace/strategies/<strategy_id>/candidates/<candidate_id>/``.

It MUST NOT import from ``../research runtime``. research runtime remains a
reference repository only — its contracts are reimplemented inside Nerya
so the runtime keeps a single source of truth.
