"""Deterministic, fixture-driven backtest engine.

Task 5: bar-by-bar target-weight rebalancing on top of the
fixture dataset, emitting trades/equity-curve/metrics + structured
:class:`ValidationReport` artifacts under the candidate directory.

The runner imports nothing from ``../research runtime``.  All formulas live
inside Nerya so the runtime keeps a single source of truth.
