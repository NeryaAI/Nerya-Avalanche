"""Route → minimum-scope authorization matrix for the local API.

Until now every authenticated request implicitly received ``scope='api:all'``,
which meant a service token issued for "read-only inspection" could in fact
mutate workspace config, pull secrets, or call ``/trading/submit``. That is
fine for a single-operator loopback box but unsafe the moment the same HTTP
entrypoint is reused by gateways, dashboards behind the proxy, or remote
clients with a non-admin token.

This module introduces a small, declarative route → scope mapping that the
HTTP server consults *after* :func:`nerya.api.auth.check_request` has
authenticated the caller. The mapping uses three lookup levels:

1. **Exact match** on ``(method, path)`` — wins over any prefix rule.
2. **Method-aware prefix** like ``("GET", "/agent/")`` — matches any path
   starting with that prefix.
3. **Method-agnostic prefix** like ``(None, "/skills/lock/")`` — matches any
   verb under that prefix, used when read/write share the same scope.

Of all matching rules the *longest* path wins. That gives us the natural
"override the family default with a specific path" pattern (e.g. the whole
``/security/`` family is gated on ``read:runtime``, but
``/security/secrets/*`` requires ``write:secrets``).

The catalog below intentionally errs on the conservative side: an unknown
or new route falls back to ``admin:*`` so adding a route without thinking
about its scope cannot accidentally widen the surface.

The wildcard scope ``api:all`` (granted automatically to local loopback in
``local`` mode) bypasses every check — owners on the dev box keep working
as before.

        HTTP verb in upper-case, or ``None`` to match any verb.
    path:
        Exact path or path prefix. A trailing ``"/"`` flags this as a
        prefix rule; an exact match (no trailing slash, e.g. ``"/skills"``)
        only fires for that single path.
    scope:
        The minimum scope required. ``None`` means "no scope check
        beyond authentication" (used for endpoints we explicitly
        publish to every authenticated caller). A pipe-separated value
        (for example ``"approve:trade|approve:tool"``) means any one of
