"""Read-only context surface handed to strategy scripts.

The script sandbox cannot freely import connectors, LLM providers, or
exchange SDKs — the static analyzer blocks that. But strategy scripts
legitimately need to reach *some* Nerya surfaces (market data, on-chain
price, indicator features) to do real work.

Rather than poking a hole in the static analyzer, the script runner
passes an explicit :class:`ScriptContext` to the entry function if it
accepts a ``ctx`` keyword. The context exposes only skill actions that
are on the ``SCRIPT_ALLOWED_SKILLS`` allowlist. Everything else raises
:class:`PermissionError`.

This keeps the script surface narrow, auditable, and extensible — any
new "strategy script can call X" capability needs one edit here plus
an entry in the allowlist below.
