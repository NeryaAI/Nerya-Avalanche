"""MetaMask-compatible agent wallet (BIP-39 / BIP-44 self-custody).

A MetaMask account is a standard BIP-39 seed with EVM derivation path
``m/44'/60'/0'/0/<index>``. This provider lets Nerya act as the agent
for such an account:

* **create** — ``nerya wallet create metamask`` generates a fresh
  12-24 word seed, stores it in the workspace SecretVault, prints the
  derived address once, and writes the ``wallet.providers.<id>``
  binding. Importing the same words into MetaMask shows the same
  address (verified against the standard BIP-44 test vectors).
* **import** — paste an existing MetaMask seed phrase or an exported
  account private key into the dashboard wallet form; it is vaultified
  automatically and referenced by ``vault://`` from ``nerya.yml``.
* **use** — balances on every supported EVM chain; live swaps where a
  router is wired (BSC / PancakeSwap v2), signed locally with the
  derived key behind the operator approval gate.

Security model (inherited from ``self_custody``): config only ever
holds ``vault://`` references — the seed/private key is resolved at
execution time and scrubbed afterwards; it is never logged, returned,
or persisted in plaintext. ``address`` in the config is an optional
checksum the operator can pin: readiness fails loudly if the seed no
longer derives it.

Solana accounts are deliberately NOT derived from the seed here
(MetaMask's Solana support uses SLIP-0010 ed25519 paths this provider
does not implement) — use the ``self_custody`` provider with a direct
Solana key for Solana.
