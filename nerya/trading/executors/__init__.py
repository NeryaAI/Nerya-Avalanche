"""Executor stack — durable, recoverable order/position state machines.

every order Nerya places is owned by an
executor. Executors are persistent (the run row in
``executor_runs``) and recoverable: an unexpected restart resumes any
non-terminal executor and re-attaches it to its outstanding orders.

The first slice of executors:

* :class:`MarketOrderExecutor` — single market or limit-equivalent
  order, used by the new TradePlan path.
* :class:`PositionProtectionExecutor` — soft-runtime TP/SL/trailing
  / time-limit / partial-exit watcher attached to a position.

Both inherit from :class:`Executor` (in :mod:`.base`) and run through
:class:`ExecutorOrchestrator` (in :mod:`.orchestrator`).
