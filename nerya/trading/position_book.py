"""Position book — event-sourced merged position + per-strategy share projection.

the position book is the *projection* of the durable fill ledger;
nothing else in Nerya is allowed to compute "what is my position right now"
from scratch. Risk gate, executors, dashboard — they all read here.

Design (v6, merged-by-account+market):

* Each ``(account_id, market)`` has **one** open row in the ``positions``
  table. Two strategies trading the same exchange + symbol no longer
  produce two independent rows; the broker only sees one merged
  position so neither does Nerya.
* Per-strategy attribution lives in ``position_shares``: each strategy
  carries its own size, avg-entry, realized PnL, fees and funding.
* The merged ``positions`` row is the algebraic sum:
  ``size_base = SUM(share.size_share_base)`` and
  ``avg_entry_price = SUM(share.size * share.avg) / size_base`` (cost
  basis), so opposite-direction shares net cleanly (strategy A long 0.5
  + strategy B short 0.3 → merged long 0.2).
* Realized PnL is **share-attributed**: when strategy A closes its slice
  the realized PnL hits A's share with A's own avg-entry — *not* the
  merged blended avg-entry. The merged ``realized_pnl_usd`` field is
  the sum of share realized PnLs, kept materialised for cheap reads.
* Every change is also recorded in ``position_events`` so we can
  replay the full lifecycle for audit and PnL attribution.

Apply a fill via :meth:`PositionBook.apply_fill`. The book finds the
open merged position (per account/market) or creates a fresh one, then
threads the fill through the originating strategy's share — opening,
adding, reducing or flipping it as needed. Reduce-then-flip is fully
supported at *both* levels: the share that submitted the fill can
flip even while the merged position stays open (because another
strategy still has size on the opposite side).

:meth:`open_positions`, :meth:`get_open` and :meth:`get_open_merged`
are the read APIs the rest of the kernel uses; per-strategy callers
should use :meth:`get_share` / :meth:`list_shares` when they want
strategy-level numbers (own PnL, own avg-entry).

We deliberately do not bake mark-price look-ups into the book — the
caller passes ``mark_price`` when they want to refresh
``unrealized_pnl_usd``, otherwise the field stays at its last
computed value.
