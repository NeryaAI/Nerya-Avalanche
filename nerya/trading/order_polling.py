"""Background poller for live orders that the legacy submit path
registered with :class:`OrderTracker`.

The :class:`MarketOrderExecutor` is event-driven inside a TradePlan run;
once that run hands off, late fills on a placed order are only visible
to the broker. This module walks the tracker's ``active_orders`` slice
every tick (driven by the same background loop infrastructure as
``_start_account_refresh_loop``), calls ``connector.get_order``,
applies any new fills to the :class:`PositionBook`, and promotes the
tracker row through terminal states.

The module exports :func:`poll_active_live_orders` so unit tests can
drive a single tick deterministically without spinning up a thread.
