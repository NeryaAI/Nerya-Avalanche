# Self Modify

Use when the operator (or a reflection tick) asks Nerya to change its own
configuration, prompts, parameters, or behaviour. Orchestration playbook
over existing safe surfaces — it adds no new mutation powers; every
durable change is a hot API call or an evolution proposal, never a bypass
of proposal → approval → apply. Surface matrix: `references/full-playbook.md`.

## Channel routing — classify FIRST, use exactly one channel

HOT (immediate, no proposal):
- Review / reflection / trading cadence: `POST /triggers/schedules/*`
  (add/update/remove/pause/resume) and `POST /evolution/reflection_schedule`.
- Runtime feature flags: `POST /runtime/flags/set` + `/runtime/flags/refresh`.
- Safety tightening: `kill_switch_set` (engage always allowed; release is operator-only).
- Paper accounts: `account_upsert` (paper mode only).
- Durable behaviour facts: `memory_remember`.

PROPOSAL via `evolve_core_config_patch` (draft the full post-change file
under `evolution/proposals/` with `write_file` first — that prefix is
writable):
- `nerya.yml` non-protected keys: LLM tiers/models/providers (`llm.*`),
  market defaults (`workspace_preferences.*`), harness caps (`agent.*`),
  memory/research/mcp/integration blocks, dashboard/api hosts.
- `agents.yml`, `workspace.yml` — agent & workspace defaults, prompt wiring.
- `policies/planner.yml`, `policies/tier_policy.yml` — decision logic.
- `news_feeds.yml`, `messages/channels.yml` (secrets as `*_ref` only), `triggers/routes.yml`.
- Skill enable/disable/delete — use `skill_manage`; do not edit `skills/enabled.yml` manually.

PROPOSAL via dedicated generators:
- Strategy parameters / strategy subagent prompts: `strategy_tuning_generate`
  (never `write_file` on `strategies/<id>/`); evidence attaches automatically.
- New behaviour / repeated workflow: `skill_manage` with action `save`
  writes the validated Workspace SKILL.md directly and enables new Skills.
- New runtime capability as code (native tool, tool-pipeline listener,
  LLM provider, team template): the `plugin_author` skill stages a
  `plugin_proposal` under `after/plugins/<id>/` (never `write_file`
  into `plugins/` directly). New executable code: never auto-applied.

ADVISORY REJECT (protected — no reroute via schedules, shell, or strategy
files): risk limits / `limits.yml`, `runtime.live_trading_enabled`,
kill-switch release, `trading.*`, `risk*`, accounts, vault, approval
policy, route rate/payload caps, `evolution.auto_apply.*`. Answer
`advisory reject: protected_scope` and point to the dashboard approval
path that owns the scope.

## Validation before submission

EVERY proposal MUST carry an executable validation plan: `unit_test`
(`python -m pytest <path>`), `static_check` (strategy code),
`backtest` (trading behaviour), `eval_scenario` (`python -m nerya.evals
--module <module>` — replay scripted agent-loop scenarios so prompt and
policy changes prove the loop still behaves). Then run
`POST /evolution/validation/run` with `dry_run=false`; unpassed required
steps block apply regardless of approval.

## Auto-apply tier (bounded autonomy)

Prose-level lane: `prompt_patch` / `core_config_patch` touching only
prompts, policies, or news feeds, ≤ 4 files, ≤ 200 changed lines,
validation fully passed, and operator-set `evolution.auto_apply.enabled:
true`. Applied by `POST /evolution/auto_apply/tick`, observed 24h,
auto-rolled-back on failing observations. NEVER attempt to widen the
lane: kinds/allowlist/thresholds are hard-coded and protected.

## After apply

RECORD outcomes with `evolve_post_apply_observation` (positive and
negative). If a change made things worse, say so plainly and roll back
via `POST /evolution/rollback` instead of stacking a correction on top.
