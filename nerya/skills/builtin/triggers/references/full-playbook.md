# Triggers playbook

A trigger is a *promise to act later*. The runtime keeps the promise
even when the agent is not in session, so the design has to assume
the agent is not around to babysit.

## Trigger shapes

Three shapes cover almost everything:

- **Schedule** — fires on a cron / interval (every day at 09:00,
every 15 minutes, …).
- **Event** — fires when an external signal arrives (price crosses
threshold, on-chain transfer hits an address, message webhook).
- **Condition watcher** — periodically re-evaluates a predicate and
fires when the answer flips.

Pick the shape that maps most directly to the user's request. Don't
encode a schedule as a watcher (wasteful) or a watcher as a schedule
(misses fast-moving events).

## Designing a trigger

Every trigger needs:

1. **A precise predicate.** "Notify me when ETH is high" is not a
  predicate; "notify me when ETH > 4000 on Coinbase spot for at
   least 5 minutes" is.
2. **An action.** What runs when the predicate fires? Default to
  small, idempotent actions (sending a message, queuing a task).
3. **An expiry.** Triggers without an end date accumulate; bake in a
  sensible TTL.
4. **A cooldown.** A trigger that can fire 200 times in a minute
  *will*. Specify a minimum interval between firings.

If you cannot fill all four fields, do not create the trigger.

## Idempotency

Trigger handlers must be safe to run more than once with the same
event id. The runtime may retry on transient errors. Either:

- the action is naturally idempotent (e.g. a message that includes
the event id), or
- the handler checks the event id against a recent-history store
before acting.

Order placement, transfers, and any "external mutation" must use the
second pattern.

## Creation surfaces

Operator-facing recurring reports and non-strategy agent/script work belong to
the `tasks` skill. Use `tasks/scripts/create_task.py` for those cases.

Lower-level trigger route changes should go through trigger APIs or proposals:
`/triggers/routes/add`, `/triggers/routes/update`, `/triggers/schedules/add`,
`/triggers/schedules/status`, and `/triggers/stats`.

Do not invent trigger scripts that are not present under this skill's
`scripts/` folder.

## Failure modes

- **Unbounded triggers.** A schedule with no expiry, a watcher with
no cooldown — both quickly become noise.
- **Predicate ambiguity.** Spell out the comparison, the operand,
the venue, the time-aggregate.
- **Forgetting cleanup.** When the user says "stop alerting me",
cancel the trigger; do not just ignore it.
