# Adapter

Mainstream execution starts with financial_readiness: Jupiter v2 swaps,
Uniswap v3/v4 and PancakeSwap v3 LP, Aave v3 and Polymarket CLOB/standard CTF.
Load financial_ops/references/mainstream-defi.md through that Skill for the
exact supported actions. Byreal remains an existing compatibility route, not
the preferred integration target. Router aggregation does not add native LP.

For the integration checklist, read [references/full-playbook.md](references/full-playbook.md).

Start with connector_list/connector_describe for venues or wallet capability
discovery for wallets. Choose the relevant branch below; this is one adapter
Skill, with protocol detail loaded only for the requested integration.

- Prediction markets: read [references/prediction-markets.md](references/prediction-markets.md).
  Use scripts/inspect_prediction.py for public outcomes, book and price history.
- CEX: extend ExchangeProviderSpec and the existing CCXT connector; preserve
  exchange feature discovery and optional protection. Do not replace CCXT with
  a new native CEX client.
- Wallets/DEX: follow the workflow below and load its contract as needed.

Choose the smallest integration supported by the target's actual API:

- Router02-compatible EVM DEX: configure evm_v2 or a self_custody/MetaMask
  dex_routes entry. Keep the chain, router and wrapped-native address explicit.
- Existing wallet SDK/API: implement WalletProvider and register it through
  the workspace plugin's ctx.register_wallet_provider. New native modules
  should hide protocol differences behind the same public methods.
- Separate language/process: use provider external and the versioned JSON
  contract in [references/contract.md](references/contract.md).

First run scripts/inspect_adapter.py with wallet_id/account_id to inspect the
selected binding. It reports methods, chains, minimum-output and confirmation
support. Optional quote checks are read-only. Missing capability is a concrete
integration gap, not permission to reinterpret the trade.

For adapter development read the contract and
[references/providers.md](references/providers.md). Use current official API
examples or captured read-only responses to build fixtures. Preserve raw/UI
units, full token identity, exact-input semantics and quote expiry. Test quote
validation, explicit rejection, submitted-to-confirmed, reverted, and timeout
recovery through the public methods. Validate the JSON fixture using
scripts/validate_contract.py; this parser check supplements protocol tests.

Live strategy orders enter ctx.trading/TradingAPI/trade_intent_submit and the
shared wallet approval flow. Implement get_execution_status as a read only
operation; a receipt query never resends a transaction. Preserve min_out and
execution_id, and call on_broadcast as soon as the send identity exists.
Confirmed means transaction evidence and actual received amount, not a quote,
order id, HTTP success or unsigned transaction. TP/SL stays optional; declare
native order/protection capabilities honestly and reject unsupported requests.

Package agent-authored adapters through the existing plugin_author proposal
workflow. Put factories in an installed workspace plugin, not import paths in
model-generated configuration. For a concrete factory example read
[references/plugin-example.md](references/plugin-example.md). Static validation
does not authorize import/activation, installation or real-money validation.

Finish with the supported methods/chains, required configuration, test results
and unverified live boundaries. Keep API keys/signers in the vault; reports and
fixtures contain no secrets or serialized signed transactions.
