# Transaction Preparation

Confirm the transaction, client-approved facts, audience, stage and requested
material. Reuse one dated fact base across the model, profile and presentation.
Distinguish disclosed data, management forecasts and analyst assumptions.
Check valuation arithmetic and consistency across every deliverable. Return
key messages, source-backed figures, open diligence items and versioned files.
Prepare rather than distribute: do not contact counterparties, reveal client
confidential information or make commitments without explicit authorization.

## Read only the matching reference

Use `Skill(skill="finance.investment_banking", file="<path>")`; follow
`next_offset` for a long method, not unrelated workflows.
