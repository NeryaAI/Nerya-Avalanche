# Private Investment Lifecycle

Start with mandate, company, transaction stage, supplied materials and decision
needed. Reuse the existing data room and diligence log rather than restarting
collection. Distinguish management assertions from independently supported
facts. Quantify assumptions and downside; connect diligence gaps to valuation
and decision conditions. Return recommendation, evidence, risks, owner-assigned
next steps and the requested memo/model. Do not make investment commitments,
contact targets or change portfolio operations without explicit authorization.
