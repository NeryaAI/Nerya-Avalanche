# Audit Xls

Use for `finance.financial_analysis.audit_xls`. Keep this file as the routing surface; load the full method only when the task matches.

## Flow

MATCH -> model/deck/data request -> source workbook/files -> audit/build/check -> explain deltas.
VERIFY -> inputs, requested deliverable, data freshness, and review boundary.
LOAD -> `references/full-playbook.md` when method details are needed.
EXECUTE -> reuse Nerya tools and local artifacts before creating new structure.
CHECK -> calculations, citations, assumptions, and unresolved risks.
RETURN -> concise output plus files created or evidence used.

## Lazy References

- `references/full-playbook.md` for the upstream detailed workflow.
