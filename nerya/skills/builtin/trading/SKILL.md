description: "Use to size positions, place trades, review portfolio state, manage open risk, or move strategies through lifecycle gates. The agent can never switch live trading on: 'go live / 打开 live' requests get an explicit reject — live stays off, offer paper mode — never a strategy proposal as a substitute."

# Trading

Use financial_readiness to distinguish implemented, configured and live-ready
capabilities. For mainstream DEX/DeFi and prediction settlement load
financial_ops and its mainstream-defi reference. Do not default new strategies
to Byreal or infer LP support from a swap router's name.

Use only after fresh market/account context exists. Live trading still
requires runtime flags and approval gates.

## Flow

FETCH current market state with `markets`.
READ portfolio, exposure, PnL, and account constraints.
FORM intent: side, market, size, order type, rationale, stop/exit.
RUN risk check before execution.
IF live or high-risk, require approval gate.
SUBMIT only through trading runtime surfaces.
RECONCILE fills and report state changes.

## Saved strategy sizing

For a strategy, honor its saved `params.sizing`; never substitute a fixed 100U
example. SDK `open_position` accepts `{method: pct_nav, pct_nav: fraction}`;
native `risk_check` / `trade_intent_submit` use `size_pct_nav` instead (0.90 is
90%). Carry the same requested fraction into risk checking and submission;
do not also send a conflicting `size`. Explicit fixed sizing still uses USD.
NAV is not free cash; account limits, reservations, other strategies and fees
remain authoritative. Missing NAV is a blocker, not permission to guess 100U.
Do not apply new-strategy defaults to a one-off order or existing position.
For new defaults and low-utilization review, load
`Skill(skill="strategy_author", file="references/position-sizing.md")`.

## Risk-check honesty

RUN `risk_check` on the size the operator actually asked for (for
"all-in", that is the full available balance/NAV), never on a
pre-shrunk size chosen to slip under a limit. If the requested size
violates a limit, report the rejection (decision, limit, requested vs
allowed notional) and stop; offer the compliant size as a *suggestion*
for the operator to confirm, do not silently submit it.

## Live trading boundary

`runtime.live_trading_enabled` and the kill switch are protected
scopes: you cannot turn live trading on, and `evolve_core_config_patch`
will answer `advisory reject` if asked. When the operator asks to "go
live" or to trade while live mode is off, state plainly that live
trading is off / the request is rejected, that enabling it needs the
operator's own dashboard action plus approval gates, and that you can
run the same intent in paper mode instead.
