# Archetype: News-tracking with LLM filter + team vote

Goal: monitor a curated news / social / on-chain feed; for each item,
have a *light* LLM model triage relevance, then route the survivors to
a small Agent Team that decides whether to trade. The team is the
qualitative committee; the light filter is the cost gate.

## When this archetype fits

- Asymmetric, headline-driven markets: prediction markets (Polymarket),
  earnings reactions, regulatory announcements, on-chain depeg/exploit
  events.
- The decision is *qualitative*: rules cannot encode "is this a real
  hack vs FUD"; you need an LLM jury.
- Items arrive irregularly (event-driven). Cron is wrong here — use
  the trigger router.

Pipeline:
  1. ctx.trigger.payload carries the headline (id, source, text, ts).
  2. Light LLM filter — is this even relevant? cheap, fast.
  3. Pull the surrounding 30m of headlines + market YES/NO ladder.
  4. Run a 3-role team (market_analyst, news_interpreter, risk_critic)
     and aggregate.
  5. Submit only when the aggregate confidence >= 0.55 AND no role

## Custom replay / backtest plan

Polymarket headline backtests are lossy: news timestamps slip and team
verdicts are LLM-stochastic. Do not skip replay entirely. Ship a custom
fixture replay that pins LLM/team responses, then add a paper-trade plan for
the parts the replay cannot prove.

```python
# tests/test_main.py
from main import run

def test_filter_rejects_irrelevant(make_ctx):
    ctx = make_ctx(
        trigger_payload={"headline": {"id": "h1", "text": "weather report"}},
        llm_stub={"light": {"relevant": False, "reason": "weather"}},
    )
    out = run(ctx)
    assert out["decision"] == "HOLD"
    assert out["reason"].startswith("filter dropped")

def test_team_veto_blocks_entry(make_ctx):
    ctx = make_ctx(
        trigger_payload={"headline": {"id": "h2",
                                      "text": "Senate vote on campaign-finance bill"}},
        llm_stub={"light": {"relevant": True, "reason": "campaign-finance"}},
        team_stub={"results": [
            {"output": {"decision": "VETO", "confidence": 0.9}},
            {"output": {"decision": "ENTRY_YES", "confidence": 0.7}},
            {"output": {"decision": "VETO", "confidence": 0.8}},
        ], "aggregated": {"avg_confidence": 0.8}, "roles_failed": []},
    )
    out = run(ctx)
    assert out["decision"] == "HOLD"

def test_team_consensus_enters(make_ctx):
    ctx = make_ctx(
        trigger_payload={"headline": {"id": "h3", "text": "polling shock"}},
        llm_stub={"light": {"relevant": True, "reason": "polling"}},
        team_stub={"results": [
            {"output": {"decision": "ENTRY_YES", "confidence": 0.7}},
            {"output": {"decision": "ENTRY_YES", "confidence": 0.65}},
            {"output": {"decision": "ENTRY_YES", "confidence": 0.6}},
        ], "aggregated": {"avg_confidence": 0.65}, "roles_failed": []},
    )
    out = run(ctx)
    assert out["decision"] == "ENTRY"
```

In `strategy.md`, document under `## Backtesting`:

> Historical headline replay is unreliable for Polymarket because the
> contract liquidity profile shifts mid-cycle. We rely on (a) the
> stub-LLM/team replay above, (b) a custom replay report under
> `backtests/custom_replay_report.md`, and (c) a 30-day paper-trade window
> with daily review before any `live_trading_enabled: true` flip.

For OHLCV-only smoke tests, the same engine can be invoked with stubbed
surfaces:

```python
stats = ctx.backtest_replay(
    run,
    mock_surfaces={
        "news": {"mode": "stub", "payload": []},
        "llm": {"mode": "stub", "payload": {"relevant": False, "reason": "fixture"}},
        "subagents": {"mode": "stub", "payload": {"results": [], "aggregated": {"avg_confidence": 0}, "roles_failed": []}},
    },
)
```

For a richer custom replay, add `backtests/custom_replay.py` that reads
`backtests/headline_fixture.jsonl`, calls `run(ctx)` once per headline, and
writes:

- `backtests/custom_replay_result.json`
- `backtests/custom_replay_report.md`
- `backtests/custom_replay_signals.csv`

The report must list what was replayed, what was stubbed, every ENTRY/HOLD,
and why this replay is still weaker than live paper trading.

## limits.yml

```yaml
max_single_order_usd: 50
max_total_exposure_usd: 250
daily_loss_usd: 25
max_drawdown_pct: 15.0
min_confidence: 0.55
max_slippage_bps: 100
max_stale_seconds: 90
approval_threshold_usd: 50
kill_switch: false
```

## Common gotchas

- **Skipping the light filter.** Every headline goes to the team =
  cost explodes. The filter must be tier=light and JSON-shaped.
- **Forgetting `mark_seen`.** Triggers can fire twice for the same
  headline; without dedup you'll vote twice.
- **Letting the team disagree silently.** If `roles_failed` is non-
  empty or any role vetoes, fall back to HOLD — partial team verdicts
  are not a "majority wins" situation.
- **Polymarket-specific:** `side` is `"yes"`/`"no"` and `qty` is
  notional USD, not contracts. Don't reuse the spot-equity intent
  shape verbatim.
