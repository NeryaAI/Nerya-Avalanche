"""Skill listing — agent-skill style.

A skill is a ``SKILL.md`` (YAML frontmatter + markdown body) — a
*prompt template*, not a bundle of typed actions. The native agent
loop discovers skills by reading SKILL.md frontmatter + body:

* List skills as ``name: description`` lines.
* When the model invokes a skill, return the markdown body verbatim —
  the body teaches the model how to combine native tools.

This module replaces the old ``action_catalog`` (which projected a
non-spec ``actions[]`` array). Anything that was previously a "skill
action" is now either:

* a native tool (registered on :class:`~nerya.tools.registry.ToolRegistry`),
  or
* a markdown procedure inside the skill body.

Permissions / risk gates / concurrency safety / fresh-read invariants
all live on :class:`~nerya.tools.types.ToolDescriptor`, not on skills.
