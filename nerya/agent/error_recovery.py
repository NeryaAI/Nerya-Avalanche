"""Error taxonomy + recovery hints for the workspace-native agent loop.

- Every error the model sees should be (a) classified and (b)
  accompanied by an actionable next step. Without this, models tend to
  loop on the same error forever; with it, they can often self-recover.

Why
---
The existing :mod:`nerya.core.error_classifier` produces an internal
category (``timeout``, ``rate_limit``, ``validation``, ``internal``,
…). That is enough for retry policy, but not enough for the LLM to
know *what to do next*.

This module adds a second, model-facing taxonomy:

* ``stale_file_read``  → "call ``read_file`` again on this exact path"
* ``patch_context_mismatch``  → "the find string is no longer present;
   re-read the file and re-anchor your edit"
* ``approval_pending``  → "the operator must approve this destructive
   step; either wait or restate the request as read-only"
* ``permission_denied``  → "this skill is not allowed in the current
   lane; pick a different action or escalate"
* ``budget_exceeded``  → "the wall-clock / call budget is exhausted;
   stop calling tools and wrap up"
* ``ambiguous_input``  → "the action requires X but the payload was
   missing/wrong; ask the user or default and retry"
* ``transient`` (timeout / rate_limit / 5xx)  → "wait + retry"
* ``unrecoverable``  → "report the failure to the user; do not retry"

Each entry carries a ``recovery_hint`` string that the kernel injects
into the synthetic observation so the next planner step has an
explicit instruction. The dashboard renders the same taxonomy as a
visible status badge ("read-stale", "approval needed", …).
