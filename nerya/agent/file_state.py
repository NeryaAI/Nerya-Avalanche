"""FileStateCache — fresh-read tracking for file edits.

  "fresh read before edit" invariant that the file_first lane enforces).

Why
---
Every coding environment has the same pathology: the model edits a file
based on stale context (its own
memory of what the file looked like a few turns ago), the on-disk copy
has since been changed by the user / a sibling tool / git, and the
edit either silently overwrites the user's work or fails because the
``find`` block no longer matches.

The fix everyone converges on is the same: track *for this turn* which
files the agent has read, hash the bytes it saw, and refuse any edit
whose target is either (a) unread or (b) read at a stale hash. The
agent must always run ``operator.read_file`` on a file before editing
it, and re-run if the disk has moved underneath.

Scope
-----
``FileStateCache`` is per-turn, in-memory state. Each entry tracks:

- ``content_hash`` — sha256 of the bytes the agent last saw on disk.
- ``last_read_seq`` — monotonic counter so we can answer "did I read
  this *after* my last write?".
- ``last_read_at`` — wall-clock timestamp for evidence bundles.
- ``last_write_seq`` — bumped whenever an edit succeeds.

The cache lives on the per-turn agent context so the kernel/operator
skill/workspace-native loop all share one view. Cross-turn carryover
is intentional: the user can keep editing the same file across many
turns without having to re-read it on every loop, *as long as* nothing
else has touched it. We re-validate by re-hashing on the way into the
edit; a stale hash trips ``StaleFileReadError`` and the agent must
``read_file`` again.

This module is deliberately tiny + deps-free so the kernel, skills
runtime, and tests can all import it without ordering hazards.
