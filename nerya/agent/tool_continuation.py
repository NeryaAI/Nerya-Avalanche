"""Typed continuation decisions around provider-emitted tool calls.

The provider may emit a tool that was not exposed in the current iteration.
Those calls must remain paired with a structured denial for auditability, but
the decision to retry, finalize, or stop a required-action branch is pure turn
policy and does not belong in the execution phase.
