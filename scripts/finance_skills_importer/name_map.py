"""Name & path conversion between upstream financial-services and Nerya.

Conventions (locked in ``deliverable.md`` after USER decision round 1):

* Upstream uses kebab-case directories: ``investment-banking/``,
  ``ic-memo/``. Nerya uses snake_case throughout.
* USER decision round 1 chose **no ``_skill`` suffix** — finance imports
  are aligned with Nerya core skills (``trading``, ``research``, …) which
  also have no suffix, rather than the newer ``equity_research_skill``
  shape.
* USER decision round 1 chose **deep namespacing**:
  ``workspace/skills/finance/<vertical>/<skill>/``.

This module is pure string/path manipulation — no I/O — so it is easy to
unit-test and to compose with the rest of the importer.
